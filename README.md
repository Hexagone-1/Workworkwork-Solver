# Workworkwork-Solver
A tool to automatically solve workworkwork puzzles.
Currently only works for levels using mechanics from chapters 1 to 4.

# How to run it

To run it, first download and extract the .zip file, then run it through terminal.

If your are on a Mac, open terminal and type "cd (the folder)" replace "(the folder)" with the actual folder. 

Then type "python3 main.py".

If you are not on a Mac, I don't know so sorry.

Apologies for this convoluted mess, the terrible interface, and the terrible code.

I will fix it sometime.
